# Introduction

`FastPCA` is a simple implementation of principal component analysis designed to run fast on matrices of varying sizes. Additionally, `FastPCA` provides users the ability to only calculate a couple PCs at time. This allows users who are only interested in the first couple PCs to save large amounts of computing time when compared with base R implementation of PCA. The workhorse function of the algorithm is the `PRIMME` eigensolver (https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/PRIMME/index.html) which allows for both partial eigendecompositon and a great increase in speed.

# Getting Started

## Installation

```{r, eval = FALSE, message=FALSE}
devtools::install_github("cresswellkg/FastPCA")
library(FastPCA)
```

## Input data

Data can be a data frame or matrix of any dimensions. For this vignette we simulate a relatively small 300 x 300 matrix

```{r}
sim_mat = matrix(runif(300^2, 0, 200), 300, 300)
```
